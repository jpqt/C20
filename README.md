# Joint Savings
A fintech startup company has recently hired you. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Instructions:

The completed Solidity JointSavings smart contract.

A folder named Execution_Results that contains at least eight images. These images should confirm that the deposit and withdrawal transactions, which are designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.

* Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

* Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM

* Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract




## Technologies

The project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) - Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum.

* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

* [Web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) - This is the Ethereum JavaScript API which connects to the Generic JSON-RPC spec.

You need to run a local or remote Ethereum node to use this library.
